# Pomodoro Clock

This is a timer with [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## Installation Instructions

Can download [the zip file](https://github.com/AndrewAung11/Pomodoro-Clock/blob/main/PomodoroClock.zip) to obtain the executable. The executable file inside the zip is already built app. No further installation is required. The app can be used after being extracted from the zip file.

## Roadmap

These are the things I want to accomplish:
- [x] Make a basic UI
- [x] Make a working timer with intervals
- [x] Add audio as alarm
- [X] Add a way to install
- [ ] Polish the UI
